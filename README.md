# Spectacles-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
The project is on Spectacles detection: - a real-time system to detect whether the person on the webcam is wearing a spectacle or not. Eye detection plays an important role in many Intelligent Human Computer Interaction (IHCI) applications such as eye tracking, eye gaze tracking, drowsiness monitoring etc. However, the presence of spectacles makes the eye detection task difficult because of the glint produced by the lens. Earlier approaches on detection of eyes occluded with spectacles have been reported in literature, however with limited accuracies. This paper proposes a real-time algorithm for detection of spectacles leading to the detection of eyes. So, I decided to create an application using Machine Learning that utilizes a camera to detect if a person is wearing a spectacle or not.
